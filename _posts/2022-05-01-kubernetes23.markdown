Check Ready Nodes

Check to see how many nodes are ready (not including nodes tainted NoScedule) and write the number to /var/CKA2022/RN0001

```shell
kubectl get nodes | grep -i -w ready

kubectl describe node hk8s-m | grep -i NoSchedule

kubectl describe node hk8s-w1 | grep -i NoSchedule
kubectl describe node hk8s-w1 | grep -i taints

echo "1" > /var/CKA2022/RN0001

```

Count the Number of NOdes That are ready to run normal workloads

Determine how many nodes in the cluster are ready to run normal workloads. 
Output this number to the file /var/CKA2022/NODE-Count

```shell
kubectl get nodes | grep -i -w ready | wc -l > /var/CKA2022/NODE-Count
cat /var/CKA2022/Node-Count
```
